xor is represented by (^)  and also known as odd 1 calculator  .

-> Truth table 
   0 ^ 0 = 0
   0 ^ 1 = 1
   1 ^ 0 = 1
   1 ^ 1 = 0  

-> Properties of xor:
   1. x^y = y^x            ( xor is commutative )
   2. (x^y)^z = x^(y^z)    ( xor is associative )
   3. x^x = 0 
   4. x^0 = x
   
-> XOR is equivalent to adding the bit representations modulo 2.
   Therefore it is commutative, associative, and reversible because 
   addition modulo any positive integer n has these properties.   
   
   Suppose, we're xor-ing the two numbers 2 and 3. Let's do it below:
     (10)⊕(11) = (01) 
    (Bit no.)	(First number)	(Second number)	 ⊕	  Sum  	   Sum (mod2)
     1st bit  	 0	              1	           1	  1	          1
     2nd bit	   1	              1	           0	  2	          0
     
   we can see that taking xor between two numbers is essentially the same as,
   for each bit positions separately, taking the sum of the two corresponding 
   bits in the two numbers modulo 2.
